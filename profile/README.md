### About reason that how i created this Cappa Linux
- I want my system use linux-zen kernel at default by low-latency and stable not vanilla...
- I love minimal and small bloated but useful for my potato laptop xd
- I was built the distro include tool for TN color screen like my screen my laptop i'm using
- I also make a tool call enchance-audio-tool use easyeffects apps that will helping improve experience of music
- I had use offline install method for calamares installer to install because sometime the mirror arch linux when on live iso not really stable and can get error any times:(
- I have added some scripts (CappaLinux-Scripts) in home folder which might help you in some cases like fix tearing on x11 wm, bluetooth support, tuned app (power management), etc.
- Default WM is awesome-wm (x11) made by https://github.com/Stardust-kyun If you see it I want to thank you because your config is great btw maybe this is the stop after the wm I tried like hyprland, niri, i3,...
- Finally, this distro is optimized for performance on lower-end machines, so don't worry about your distro having problems like crashing or lagging ;)
- The last one that all my knowledge of creating the custom arch distro is here: https://arcolinux.com. Big thanks to all who are teacher of ArcoLinux helping me with amazing docs and how i can add calamares into my distro:3
- All contributions are welcome if you encounter any issue you can open issue in github. I will find every way to help you :D
- I also thanks you to who give me a trust to trying this Cappa Linux! all your time installing this i really appreciate!:D


### Note: That my distro not really stable in all time because that was made by 1 person (me) lol xd
